# ReactionScript

### What it is
ReactionScript is a very high level language with a similar syntax to Javascript. It easily allows people new to writing software to quickly grasp some modern front-end programming paradigms.

### How it works
The parser itself is written in Javascript.

But what will effectively be the interpreter will consume the abstract syntax tree that the parser spits out, and interact directly with an implementation of Redux and some predefined React components.
